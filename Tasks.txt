Not priority:
- Add a 5 seconds delay after fullscreen, with a regressive counter div that then will disappear after finished counting; together with disappearing, will execute a function to run the rest of the scripts and the music
- faster way of preloading CSS active background images (by leveraging the above)
-? load CSS from external file
